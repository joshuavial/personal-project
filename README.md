# Personal Project

A Game with HTML 5, HTML 5 Canvas, CSS and JS.

# To Do

- Responsive Canvas In Browser Window.
    + https://mobiforge.com/design-development/html5-mobile-web-canvas
- Refactor code so its DRY.
    + Objects / classes (models?) for generating new entities
    + Overall architecture (more smaller files rather than one huge file)
- Get bullets to fire in intended direction rather than randomly generated.
- Render a map image (background) to the canvas.
- Sprites / animations for entities.
